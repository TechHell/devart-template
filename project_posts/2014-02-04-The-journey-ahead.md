Having worked in recent years almost exclusively on various projects deeply embedded in corporate NDA culture, I was super thrilled to first have been invited to pitch an idea for Google DevArt, then have it accepted and now being able to develop this large project from start to end completely in the open. After a couple of months of refining the idea, researching hardware and software options & approaches, here we are at the beginning of another ambitious adventure involving lots of different technologies (some very new to me) and also use this as an opportunity to further test drive several new libraries I've been intensely working on over the past couple of years, and which will be released as part of this process. So I consider this commission a personal milestone and am confident I will learn as much as everyone else taking part. I hope

Since this project is as much about artistic creation as it is research, there're several key aspects & questions I've been attempting to address and find answers for and which are deeply connected:

* Co-creation & shared authorship
* The potential of a severely limited generative design process
* New UI metaphors for interacting with and manipulating the design process
* Use of evolutionary principles to achieve re-use and create social pressure & influencing individual design approaches
* Digital fabrication in a museum context & performance art

All of these issues will be further explored as this project progresses and I'm looking extremely forward to discussing these points once there are tangible talking points (prototypes) available.
